      This section contains information regarding any advance directive pertaining to a patient and a reference to the most
      up to date supporting documents for the directives.  This is used to describe such information as a patients resusitation
      status and the like.
      
      
      The type element is a codedValue object that is used to describe what kind of advance directive this is.  This specification does not currently
      state a required code system such as SNOMED CT that should be used, this may change is future versions of the schema. The use of the codedValues
      attributes are optional but a system must at the very least include a free text description of the directive as the value of the type element.
      
      The date element denotes the date the directive was last updated.
      
      The optional custodian element describes the person who currently is responsible for maintaing the advance directive.
      
      As with most other hData sections there is a informationSource (where this data originated) and description( free text narrative section) defined for this 
      element, both of which are optional.
